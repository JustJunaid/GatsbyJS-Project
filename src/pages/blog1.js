                                <p>This is the second major release of TheSaaS which is based on the stable release of Bootstrap 4. The previous version (v1.x) is based on the Bootstrap 4 alpha-6. As the version number implies, this release contains a lot of breaking changes due to breaking changes from Bootstrap 4. So there's not any guide on how to upgrade from TheSaaS v1.x to TheSaaS v2.x. Since the v1.x is already stable enough, you don't have to upgrade your project at all—unless you have enough time to recreate it using the current release of TheSaaS. But if you're starting new project, TheSaaS v2.x is the right choice.</p>
